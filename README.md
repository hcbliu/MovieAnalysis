# Movie Analysis
This project is currently in progress. The goal is to evaluate movies by various socially conscious criteria. 

## Objective  
Our goal is to create an app that displays information about movies. For example, a user may want to know how socially conscious the movie Inception is. The app prompts the user to type in the name of the movie, and then returns information about the movie which includes: movie title, release year, short synopsis, Bechdel test scores, explanation of the test scores, % of cast that are women, ratings, etc.

## Structure  
The respository is structured as follows:  
-Readme (this doc): summarizes most important information about the project    
-mastercode.py: this is our project's python code, combining different people's work  
-docs folder: this contains misc. info about the project (all of which is also in our shared google drive)  
  
Everyone also has an individual branch containing the latest work that they sent via email as of 2.26.20.

## Data  
Data sources are listed below:
