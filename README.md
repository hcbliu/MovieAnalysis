# Movie Analysis
This project is currently in progress. The goal is to evaluate movies by various socially conscious criteria. 

The user will enter a movie title (or actor/actress) and receive information on the summary, views, ratings, etc. The search results returned will contain information that tells the user how socially conscious the movie is based on various criteria, such as whether or not it passes the Bechdel Test.
